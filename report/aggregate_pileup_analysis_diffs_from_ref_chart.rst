Interactive chart showing mismatch mutation differences from reference genome for the consensus assembled from the deep sequencing.
You can use the drop downs to select to show all mutations or just those that are "towards" the identity in related viral sequences.
You can mouse over the points to get number of read base calls supporting each nucleotide identity at each site called different from the reference.
