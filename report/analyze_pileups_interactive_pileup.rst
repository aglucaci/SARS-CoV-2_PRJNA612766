Pileup chart of coverage of deep sequencing of {{ snakemake.wildcards.sample }} for the different aligners and reference genomes.
The pileup only includes read sites with Q scores of at least {{ snakemake.config.minq }}.
This chart is interactive, and you can zoom in, mouseover to read stats for specific sites, and select the aligner or reference genome of interest.
